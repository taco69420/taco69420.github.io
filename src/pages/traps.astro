      <h2>Precision Tools: High-Tension Wire Traps</h2>
      <p>These aren't your standard cheap box traps. High-tension stainless steel wire traps (like the Macabee or Cinch style) are built for the main tunnel lines. You aren't just setting a trap; you're intercepting them right at the source.These are my daily drivers.They fit perfectly into most tunnel but a Bagger tip is put them back to back so you can get them from either direction.</p>

    <li><strong>The Victor Standard:</strong> These "Easy Set" style traps are my daily drivers for main tunnel lines.</li>
    <li><strong>Humane Dispatch:</strong> If you get a leg-catch, be ready to handle it quickly—I’ve used a pellet gun in the past to ensure they don't suffer.</li>
    <li><strong>The Peanut Butter Trick:</strong> Don’t set them dry. A small dab of peanut butter behind the trigger plate makes them commit to the spot for a guaranteed catch.</li>

      <h2>Chemical Warfare: Gopher Gassers</h2>
      <p>Sometimes you need to clear a deep, complex network. Gassers are a consumable option that aggressively smoke out the tunnels. Just make sure you plug all the exit holes first, or you're just putting on a light show for the neighborhood.</p>
