      <h2>Precision Tools: High-Tension Wire Traps</h2>
      <p>These aren't your standard cheap box traps. High-tension stainless steel wire traps (like the Macabee or Cinch style) are built for the main tunnel lines. You aren't just setting a trap; you're intercepting them right at the source.</p>

      <h2>Chemical Warfare: Gopher Gassers</h2>
      <p>Sometimes you need to clear a deep, complex network. Gassers are a consumable option that aggressively smoke out the tunnels. Just make sure you plug all the exit holes first, or you're just putting on a light show for the neighborhood.</p>
