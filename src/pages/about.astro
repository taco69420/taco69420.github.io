      <h2>The Origin Story</h2>
      <p>I'm Mark. The "Mark the Bagger" title isn't just a screen name—it started years ago when my dad started paying me to trap the gophers tearing up our yard. What started as a way to make a few bucks turned into an absolute science.</p>
      <p>I built this site to cut through the garbage advice online. I only recommend the traps, gassers, and methods that actually work in the real world when you're out there digging in the dirt.</p>

  <h2>The Legend of Taco</h2>

  <p>Every great trapper needs a partner, and for a long time, that was Taco. He was a natural—he had that pouncing instinct you just can't teach.</p>
  <p>While I was mastering the science of tunnel placement and wire traps, Taco was the one pinpointing exactly where the movement was. He was an absolute expert at the "wait and pounce" method, and between the two of us, no gopher stood a chance in our yard.</p>
