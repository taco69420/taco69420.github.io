      <h2>The Origin Story</h2>
      <p>I'm Mark E Hensley III. The "Mark the Bagger" title isn't just a screen name—it started years ago when my dad started paying me to trap the gophers tearing up our yard. What started as a way to make a few bucks turned into an absolute science.</p>
      <p>I built this site to cut through the garbage advice online. I only recommend the traps, gassers, and methods that actually work in the real world when you're out there digging in the dirt.</p>
