      <h2>The Bagger's Secret: Dog-Assisted Flooding</h2>
      <p>Flooding a tunnel system is a classic low-tech solution. But here is the trick to making it highly effective: <strong>if you have a small dog, bring them out with you.</strong></p>
      <p>While you pump water into the main run, have your dog monitor the yard. Their nose is infinitely better than your eyes at detecting a gopher moving toward a secondary exit hole to escape the rising water.</p>
      <p>When your dog alerts to a specific spot, you know exactly where to stand ready with your shovel or trap. It turns a guessing game into a precision strike.</p>
