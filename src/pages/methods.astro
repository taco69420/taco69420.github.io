      <h2>Passive Defense: Vibration Poles</h2>
      <p>Think of these as your background firewall. Ultrasonic and vibrational stakes aren't going to eliminate a massive infestation on their own, but they are fantastic deterrents when paired with traps or soil treatments. Place them every 30-45 feet and move them weekly so the gophers don't get used to the pattern.</p>

      <h2>Precision Capture: Live Wire Traps</h2>
      <p>If you need to relocate the gopher (or if local laws require it), two-door live traps placed directly in the main runway are your best bet. Always wire the trap to a surface stake so the gopher doesn't drag it deeper into the network, and check it every 12 hours.</p>
